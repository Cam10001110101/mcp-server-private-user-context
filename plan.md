Below is a high-level plan outlining how to build an MCP server that securely stores users’ PII and personal context documents while remaining lightweight and capable of dynamically invoking tools when a user’s prompt references personal details:

Define Requirements and Use Cases
 • List the specific types of PII and personal documents you intend to store (e.g., contact info, preferences, context summaries).
 • Identify triggers—for example, keywords or name references (like “mom,” “sister,” “friend”)—that will call the associated tools.

Design the Architecture
 • Adopt the standard MCP client–server architecture, separating the data layer, business logic, and tool invocation modules.
 • Use a modular design so you can swap out components (e.g., database or encryption module) in the future (see MCP’s core architecture guidelines ).

Choose a Database and Define the Data Model
 • Since you prefer a lightweight option, start with SQLite. Its simplicity and file-based nature make it ideal for embedded scenarios.
 • Design a schema that segregates PII (with fields for names, addresses, etc.) from contextual documents and insights.
 • Consider future-proofing your design by isolating sensitive fields for encryption or even transitioning to another lightweight database (e.g., DuckDB) if needed.

Implement Security and Compliance Measures
 • Ensure data-at-rest security by encrypting the SQLite database file or using application-level encryption for sensitive columns.
 • Enforce strict access controls and secure communication (e.g., TLS) if the server is exposed remotely.
 • Follow data privacy best practices and relevant regulations (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA) as suggested in MCP security guidelines .

Develop Tool Invocation and Context Detection
 • Create a module that analyzes user prompts to detect personal references (names, family members, or context-specific keywords).
 • Use MCP’s standardized tool invocation mechanism so that when a trigger is detected, the appropriate tool retrieves or processes the personal data.
 • For example, when the prompt mentions “mom” or “preferences,” the tool could fetch stored insights and integrate them into the conversation.

Build the MCP Server
 • Implement the server using an MCP SDK or framework in your preferred language (Python or TypeScript, for example).
 • Integrate SQLite for the data storage layer and include middleware for encryption and secure authentication.
 • Expose endpoints (using MCP requests and notifications) for reading, writing, and processing PII and context documents.

Testing and Deployment
 • Write unit and integration tests for your data access layer, security modules, and tool invocation logic.
 • Simulate user prompts to verify that context detection correctly triggers the corresponding tools.
 • Package your server for deployment (consider containerization with Docker for consistent environments) and plan for monitoring/logging to audit sensitive data access.

Future Enhancements
 • As requirements evolve, evaluate alternative databases or hybrid solutions that combine SQLite’s light footprint with additional scalability.
 • Enhance NLP capabilities for more nuanced context detection and tool selection, possibly integrating additional LLM-based processing.
